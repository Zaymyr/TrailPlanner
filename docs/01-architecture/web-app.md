# Web App Architecture

## Purpose

The web app owns the browser planner, onboarding/account flows, admin catalog tools, server-side API routes, and most Supabase service-role operations. Read this before changing `apps/web` routes or planner state.

## Key Concepts

- App Router: Next.js app routes live under `apps/web/app`.
- Server API route: a Next.js route handler that wraps Supabase, Stripe, RevenueCat, or storage calls.
- Verified session: browser session state verified against Supabase by `/api/auth/session`.
- Service role: server-only Supabase key used for privileged database and storage operations.
- Planner values: JSON payload saved in `race_plans.planner_values`.

## Framework Setup

`apps/web/package.json` marks the package as ESM with `"type": "module"`. Main scripts are:

- `npm run dev --workspace apps/web`
- `npm run build --workspace apps/web`
- `npm run start --workspace apps/web`
- `npm run lint --workspace apps/web`
- `npm run test --workspace apps/web`
- `npm run typecheck --workspace apps/web`

`apps/web/next.config.mjs` enables:

- optional MDX page support when MDX dependencies are available;
- `experimental.typedRoutes = true`;
- `eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds = true`;
- transpilation of `@trailplanner/shared` and `@pace-yourself/design-system`;
- custom SVG handling through SVGR for component imports.

## Main Runtime Areas

### Authentication and Session

The client session entry point is `apps/web/app/hooks/useVerifiedSession.tsx`. It:

- reads and writes tokens through `apps/web/lib/auth-storage.ts`;
- verifies access tokens by calling `apps/web/app/api/auth/session/route.ts`;
- passes refresh tokens through the `x-refresh-token` header when needed;
- fetches entitlements through `apps/web/lib/entitlements.ts`;
- clears planner local storage on sign-out.

The session API route validates Supabase users through `apps/web/lib/supabase.ts`, calls `ensureTrialStatus`, accepts pending coach invites, and sets HTTP-only cookies through auth cookie helpers.

### Planner API

Saved plans are handled by `apps/web/app/api/plans/route.ts`. The route:

- verifies a bearer token with Supabase anon config;
- reads and writes `race_plans`;
- stores planner state in `planner_values`;
- stores elevation in `elevation_profile`;
- checks entitlements before creating extra plans;
- enriches aid stations with nutrition when `fuelTypes` are present.

Catalog race plan creation is handled by `apps/web/app/api/plans/from-catalog/route.ts`. It copies GPX from `race-gpx` into `plan-gpx`, parses elevation, and creates `plan_aid_stations`.

### Race Catalog and GPX

Admin catalog creation lives in `apps/web/app/api/race-catalog/route.ts`. It requires an admin user, validates GPX, can create a `race_events` row, uploads GPX to the private `race-gpx` bucket, uploads images to `race-images`, and inserts `races` plus `race_aid_stations`.

User-created private races live in `apps/web/app/api/races/route.ts`. They are inserted with `is_public: false` and `created_by` set to the authenticated user.

### Billing and Entitlements

Stripe routes live under `apps/web/app/api/stripe`:

- `checkout/route.ts`: creates subscription checkout sessions.
- `portal/route.ts`: creates billing portal sessions.
- `price/route.ts`: fetches the configured Stripe price and caches it for 5 minutes.
- `webhook/route.ts`: verifies Stripe signatures and updates `subscriptions`, `coach_profiles`, and coach status.

RevenueCat routes live under `apps/web/app/api/revenuecat`. They synchronize mobile purchases into the same `subscriptions` table with provider `google` or `apple`.

## Security Posture

Server routes generally use:

- `extractBearerToken` and `fetchSupabaseUser` from `apps/web/lib/supabase.ts`;
- `withSecurityHeaders` from `apps/web/lib/http.ts`;
- service-role requests only in server code;
- route-level rate limiting through `checkRateLimit` or `checkRateLimitAsync`.

See [../04-auth-and-security/rls-checklist.md](../04-auth-and-security/rls-checklist.md) before changing a route that bypasses client RLS.

## Gotchas

- Do not store service-role keys in client code. `getSupabaseServiceConfig` is server-only by usage.
- `planner_values` is intentionally flexible JSON. Validate route inputs, but do not assume every old plan has every current field.
- `/api/race-catalog` and `/api/races` both write `races`, but the admin route creates public catalog rows and the user route creates private rows.
- `race_events` is used by API routes, but this repo only shows a migration altering it, not creating it. See [../02-database/tables/race-events.md](../02-database/tables/race-events.md).
